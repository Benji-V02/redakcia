Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows
with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub.
Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.

Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained.
Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.
Atom is written in CoffeeScript and Less, but much of it has been converted to JavaScript.

The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge.
If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral.
If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions.
