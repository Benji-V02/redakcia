An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element.
Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms.
Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across.

Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained.
Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.
Atom is written in CoffeeScript and Less, but much of it has been converted to JavaScript.

The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge.
If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral.
If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions.
