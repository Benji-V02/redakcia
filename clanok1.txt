Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows
with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub.
Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.
----
Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained.
Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.
Atom is written in CoffeeScript and Less, but much of it has been converted to JavaScript.
----
Like most other configurable text editors, Atom enables users to install third-party packages and themes to customize the features and looks of the editor.
Packages can be installed, managed and published via Atom's package manager apm.
Syntactic highlighting support for other languages than the default, can be installed through the packages, as well as the auto-complete function.
