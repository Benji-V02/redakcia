An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element.
Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms.
Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across.

Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus.
The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons.
Only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus.
